===== GETTING STARTED =====
    Welcome to the program! We begin in ProgramMain. Run the main method and let's begin.

    You will be asked if you would like to read from a file or not:
    If you choose to read from a file, you will be reading from the presets we have provided. See below for details.
    If you choose not to, you will be starting from scratch.

    Follow the prompts on screen for either option. See the defaults provided and adding user section below for
    conditions and additional details.

    You are now asked if you would like to sign in as a new or existing user.
    The new user option is for registering a new account and existing user is for logging in as an existing user.
    If you decide to create a new user, see the new user account conditions section.
    If working with the defaults provided and signing in as an existing user, see the defaults section below
    for the usernames and passwords of existing users.
