# Conference
Creates a conference with talks, users, and events for users to manipulate. Uses SOLID principles as well as JDBC + MySQL.
MySQL database creation code is included in program, but must download MySQL first and set it up.

This was completed in a group of 8 students.

Phase 1 shows the initial completed project
Phase 2 shows improvements to UI, functionality, and adds persistance via the database instead of .ser files. Also more closely follows clean architecture and SOLID principles, and uses more design patterns.
