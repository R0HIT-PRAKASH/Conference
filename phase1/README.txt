Welcome to the program! We begin in ProgramMain. Run the main method and let's begin.

You will be asked if you would like to read from a file or not:
If you choose to read from a file, you will be reading from the users.ser, messages.ser, events.ser and rooms.ser files
that we have provided, and you will begin the program with defaults;
If you choose not to read from a file, you will not be starting from any defaults.
Follow the prompts on screen for either option. See the defaults provided and adding user details below for conditions
and additional details.

You are now asked if you would like to sign in as a new or existing user.
The new user option is for registering a new account and existing user is for logging in as an existing user.

Once you follow all prompts and are logged into your account, you will be provided a menu of options. Enter the
corresponding number to perform that task.
After completing a task, you can enter ask to be shown the menu again, or end the program. 
The corresponding numbers for these are provided for your reference:
     Organizers: 14 to be shown the menu of options, 17 to end the program 
     Attendees: 7 to be shown the menu of options, 8 to end the program
     Speakers: 4 to be shown the menu of options, 5 to end the program

Once you are done using the program for the time being, and want to save your files, you MUST end the program using the
reference above, or else your data will not be saved.
