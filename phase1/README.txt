Welcome to the program! We begin in ProgramMain. Run the main method and let's begin.

You will be asked if you would like to read from a file or not:
If you choose to read from a file, you will be reading from the users.ser, messages.ser, and rooms.ser files that we have provided, and you will begin the program with defaults; 
If you choose not to read from a file, you will not be starting from any defaults.
Follow the prompts on screen for either option. 

You are now asked if you would like to sign in as a new or existing user. 
The new user option is for registering a new account and existing user is for logging in as an existing user.

(If you choose to create a new account, the following conditions hold: 
your username and password must be at least 3 characters, name at least 2 characters, and address at least 6 characters.)

Once you follow all prompts and are logged into your account, you will be provided a menu of options. Enter the corresponding number to perform that task. 
After completing a task, you can enter ask to be shown the menu again, or end the program. 
The corresponding numbers for these are provided for your reference:
     Organizers: 14 to be shown the menu of options, 17 to end the program 
     Attendees: 7 to be shown the menu of options, 8 to end the program
     Speakers: 4 to be shown the menu of options, 5 to end the program
